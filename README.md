My coding adventure
I don't know why I am learning how to code after obtaining a degree in engineering. 
Shouldn't I be submitting applications for jobs and studying for professional exams? 
But my guts telling me to start learning how to code.
I don't even know what direction I'm headed.
This experience is as scary as it is thrilling.
Something about it just seems like it is what I've always wanted to do.
I want to be able to simplify the things that seem hard.
I want to create things that solve problems.
It is 3:29pm, 8th jan 2022. And I am currently worried about my houserent.
I hope it is all worth it at the end of the day.
